<h1>Nanomagnetic Memory </h1>
<p>Nanomagnetic memory is the idea of using nanomagnets to store data in computers instead of current random access memory (RAM).
Nanomagnetic memory could be more energy efficient than current RAM and could also allow for increased data storage capacity. Nanomagnetic memory is also non-volatile in nature (which is explained below).

<h2>a.) Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM)</h2>
<p>MRAM is a memory technology where data is stored in magnetic elements that could offer increased data density while consuming less power. Data stored on MRAM is also non-volatile, i.e. it is retained even after the power supply is turned off. The data is encoded in the magnetization state of the nanomagnets and is unlikely to spontaneously switch to an alternate state. This makes the data stored in this manner highly robust, meaning that it can stay in its current state for many years.

<h2>b.) Spin-Transfer Torque Random Access Memory (STTRAM)</h2>
<p>STTRAM is the idea of using spin-transfer torque to write data in nanomagnetic memory. STTRAM is very similar to MRAM, but it consumes less power and is easier to implement on a smaller scale than MRAM.
Currently, reducing the amount of current needed to write a data bit in STTRAM is being studied by scientists and companies alike. This is an ongoing process that will hopefully lead to a powerful new way to store data in computers and hard drives in the near future.

<h1>Nanomagnetic Logic</h1>
<p>Nanomagnetic Logic (NML) is an emerging low-power computing paradigm based on a group of interacting nanomagnets, where each nanomagnet is small enough to contain only one magnetic domain. Here, the direction of the magnetization of each nanomagnet can be used to store the binary logic state, just like in nanomagnetic memory. The interaction between these ‘nanomagnets’, they can be used to perform logic operations that are accomplished by transistors in today’s computers. However, with nanomagnetic logic, the goal is to perform these operations while consuming very little power.<br><br>
The energy-efficiency of this scheme is established in the manner in which the magnetization orientations of the nanomagnets are flipped. The clocking of these “bits” is generally accomplished either by a nearby magnetic field generated by an external electric current or through a spin-polarized current that generates a spin-transfer torque (STT) in the “clocked” nanomagnet. <br><br>
A new, innovative technique involving the application of a voltage to the piezoelectric layer to generate a strain which is transferred to a magnetrostrictive layer thereby rotating its magnetization, termed “Straintronics”, offers superior energy efficiency.
