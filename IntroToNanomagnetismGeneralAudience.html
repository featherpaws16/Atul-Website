<h1>Magnetism </h1>
<p> First we must ask, what is magnetism? Well, magnetism is an interesting phenomenon
that causes an object to either be attracted to or repelled by another object. It is caused by the magnetic fields of magnets, 
which are “lines of force” created by magnetic poles that exert a force on other magnetic poles. Magnetic fields can be represented by arcing lines that go from the "north pole" of a magnet to the "south pole" on the outside of a bar magnet, for instance (pictured below).

<br>
<p>Earth itself also has a magnetic field and it affects many magnetic materials around the planet. But not all materials are magnetic, and only a few can be made into magnets or affected by magnets.
In magnetism, the old adage of "opposites attract" is particularly relevant because the north and south pole of two magnets would attract each other, while two of the same poles will repel one another.
You can see magnetic effects when you sprinkle iron filings or powder on a piece of paper held above a magnet and notice the tiny iron pieces aligning themselves along the field lines of the magnet.

<h1>Nanomagnetism</h1>
<p>Nanomagnetism is the area of magnetism that involves magnetic components having dimensions usually in the range of 1 – 100 nanometers (1 nm = 10-9 m). 
Nanomagnets are in many types of living beings, particularly birds and other animals that go to warmer climates in the Winter. Birds use the Earth's magnetic field and their nanomagnetic elements to determine which direction is south when the go south for the Winter.
<br>

<p>Some of the most enterprising and lucrative applications of nanomagnetism have been in the fields of data storage, for instance, in the hard disks used in computers and laptops.<br>
One example of data storage is the use of nanomagnets in Magnetic Random Access Memory (MRAM) instead of the conventional RAM used in today's computers, which uses electric charge. This could allow for a greater amount of data to be stored on computers with lower power requirements.<br>
<br>
The physics of nanomagnetism is also being extensively researched for low-power computing, where the magnetic states of nanomagnets are utilized to perform logic operations, much like conventional semiconductor-based transistor Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT, etc.). The goal is to realize a computing paradigm that performs these logical operations reliably while consuming very little power.
